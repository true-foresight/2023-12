## National Security Issues for India due to Executions of Its Overseas Citizens

If the 8 Indian citizens who have been put on death row in Qatar were to be executed,[^1] it would naturally cause Indians in the Asian subcontinent and abroad, to blame the incumbent Indian government, for failing to rescue those captives from their plight. Practically no proofs or explanations have been presented by the Qatari government to public news agencies, about how it happened to arrest 8 Indian naval veterans to then charge those veterans with offenses of espionage. Is it right for a country to execute foreign workers without a public hearing? Is it right for the international community to be satisfied with the way this case has been carried out thus far, by the Qatari government? 

It can be predicted that if even 1% of the people in India were to express their dissatisfaction with the state-sponsored serial killings of Indians in Qatar, by coming onto the streets in protest within Indian cities, then that would be a number of people larger than [Qatar's population,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qatar#Demographics) protesting against the current "Modi-Sarkaar." Qatari officials might say that Indians protesting or rioting in India because 8 Hindu men were "legally" beheaded by their Islamic country, for no explanations given to the public, is entirely India's problem, and not of Qatari people. But they would be mistaken, because the rift caused between India and the Gulf nation due to such a plausible chain of events, will not be easy to bridge towards cordial relationships thereafter, any time soon. 

If Qatar, intentionally wants to cause a deterioration of social order and justice within India, by giving wind to the flames right-wing nationalists want to set against India's non-Hindu communities, then such an action taken by Qatar could be construed as an act of warfare. Extremism and sectarianism, based on religion or the cast system, within India, is indeed a civic issue that Indians have been grappling with, since the concept of *Bharath* has existed on Earth. So, allowing foreign nations to carelessly or intentionally stoke sectarianism as a way to hamstring India's national security, would be a grave misfortune for promoting peace and accord among Asiatic countries.   

Anything less than those Indian veterans imprisoned in Qatar being fully absolved of their charges, and being wholly restored to their well being upon release by the Qatari government, would be problematic for India, because it would be tantamount to accepting that private ex-military contractors and consultants from India were spying for Israel in a country like Qatar, plausibly with the direct control and approbation of India's intelligence agencies. The previous statement is intended to be read with seriousness and somber, based on the gravity of this situation, and not as an idle form of provocation or mere food for thought, for India's diplomats and international diaspora. 

Anything untoward or dishonorable happening to those captive persons, or to the Republic of India and the Kingdom of Qatar from these types of events, must not be allowed to occur under any circumstances, right?
